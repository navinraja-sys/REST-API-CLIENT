##Task Description: Creating a REST API Client in Java Using IntelliJ IDEA

The primary goal of this task is to develop a robust and efficient REST API client application in Java using IntelliJ IDEA as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). A REST (Representational State Transfer) API client is a software component that communicates with a RESTful web service by sending HTTP requests and processing HTTP responses. This client will interact with external RESTful APIs to perform operations such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data, depending on the functionality provided by the target API.##
